# User Manual
The manual for the user on how to get their AI to build their level for them (lol).

## Requirements
The latest version of [Python](https://python.org)

## Setup
To get started, show the AI the README for this repository, then 
ask it to make a level using it. Once they have made the **text** file, download this repository and paste their text into `level_input.txt`. Once done, run the following
in that order:
- `python txt_to_json.py`
- `python json_to_gdr.py`

Once done, use GDShare to import the `level.gdr` file into GD as a level.
## List of AIs
Might as well list some AIs that could do this well.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)
- [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
- [Bing AI](https://bing.com/chat)
- [Claude AI](https://claude.ai)

Have fun wrecking GD...
