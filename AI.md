# Instructions for the AI
Generate a Geometry Dash level based on the user's choice (unless they said the choice was yours). For syntax and formatting, see the `README.md` file. Only use the objects and IDs found in `IDs.md`. Generate it as text ready to be used in `level_input.txt`. Ignore all `.py` files in this repository.
